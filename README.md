# 🥦🍔Lunchilicious🌭🍱

This is my final project from CMPS 355: Mobile app development. It's a food order app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. 

The app originally featured a connection to web services using the Retrofit API. Unfortunately, these web services are no longer running. So, I've updated the app to run entirely on a local database.
