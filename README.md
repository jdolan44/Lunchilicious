# Lunchilicious  
This is my final project from CMPS 355: Mobile app development. It's a food order app built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app also features a connection to web services using the Retrofit API.  

Unfortunately, the final version of the app cannot be run successfully without access to the University's VPN. 
There was an earlier version that did not depend on this, so I hope to add an updated branch which can
run entirely on a local database. Stay tuned!
